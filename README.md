## 📌 Google Cloud Core Data Services

This section highlights key Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services aligned with the **Professional Data Engineer** exam guide, focusing on designing, building, and operationalizing data processing systems.

---

### 🔄 Data Ingestion

- **Cloud Pub/Sub**  
  A globally distributed, real-time messaging service that decouples senders and receivers of data. Ideal for ingesting event streams and building event-driven architectures.

- **Dataflow (Streaming mode)**  
  Fully managed service for real-time stream processing using Apache Beam. Ingests, transforms, and enriches data in motion.

- **Transfer Services**  
  Includes Storage Transfer Service and BigQuery Data Transfer Service for batch ingestion from on-prem, other clouds, or SaaS platforms.

- **Cloud IoT Core** *(retired but was part of exam guide)*  
  Previously used for ingesting telemetry data from IoT devices securely.

---

### 📦 Data Storage

- **Cloud Storage**  
  Durable and scalable object storage for both structured and unstructured data. Supports lifecycle rules, versioning, and multiple storage classes (Standard, Nearline, Coldline, Archive).

- **BigQuery**  
  Serverless, highly scalable enterprise data warehouse optimized for analytics. Also acts as a long-term analytical storage solution.

- **Cloud Spanner**  
  Globally distributed, strongly consistent relational database with horizontal scalability. Useful for operational workloads needing transactional support.

- **Cloud SQL / Cloud Firestore / Bigtable**  
  - **Cloud SQL**: Managed SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) for transactional workloads.  
  - **Firestore**: NoSQL document database for serverless apps.  
  - **Bigtable**: Wide-column NoSQL database ideal for time-series and IoT data storage.
