",Google,"I had a very disappointing experience at this coffee truck. The service was terrible - the staff were rude and inattentive, and we had to wait a long time for our food and drinks. The food itself was mediocre at best - the coffee was weak and the pastries were stale. The shop itself was also very cramped and noisy, making it difficult to relax and enjoy our time there. To top it all off, the prices were very high, making the whole experience even worse. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.",3998,8844,2024-02-12 09:03:10 UTC
